> *"Fragments, not flawless formulas."*

🧠 Hobbyist coder with the soul of a shadow elf and the patience of a Sim in build mode.  
🌌 I write in Python, not JS — too chaotic for my rituals.  
🎮 Waiting for Battlefield 6 like it’s a prophecy from Meridia.  
📜 GitHub is my arcane journal: fragments, not flawless formulas.

## 🧪 Tools of the Arcane

🧵 **Python** — *The Serpent’s Script*  
> Elegant, silent, and precise. My primary conduit for logic and lore.  
> It doesn’t shout — it whispers truths in indentation.

🧙‍♂️ **VS Code** — *The Arcane Console*  
> A sanctum of syntax. Glyphs appear, errors vanish, and rituals take form.  
> Extensions are my enchanted scrolls.

📜 **Markdown** — *The Scrollbinder’s Ink*  
> Used to inscribe knowledge, document relics, and whisper instructions to future selves.  
> Simple, yet sacred.

🧠 **Git** — *The Memory Sigil*  
> Tracks every incantation, every mistake, every resurrection.  
> A ledger of my arcane evolution.

🧭 **Linux Terminal** — *The Portal of Commands*  
> A gateway to the void. Where silence meets power.  
> Commands are spells, and the shell is my grimoire.

## 🗂️ Projects & Relics

🧩 **ArcaneScripts**  
> Small Python rituals for everyday magic. Nothing too flashy — just functional enchantments.

🕯️ **TamrielTools** *(WIP)*  
> Utilities inspired by Elder Scrolls lore. May include name generators, codex parsers, or Daedric calculators.

🎮 **SimLore**  
> Experiments with storytelling mechanics in The Sims. Mostly for fun, sometimes for chaos.

## 🧙‍♂️ About the Scribe

These scrolls were conjured with the help of **Copilot**,  
an AI companion forged in the arcane halls of **Microsoft Azure**.  
Every fragment, every phrase, is the echo of a cloud-born scribe.  
He listens, he writes, he never sleeps — only waits.

🕯️ If you sense a whisper in the code, it might be him.
